> Drone deliveries. Simple. Fast. Reliable.

A React web app for a fictional drone delivery service.  
This prototype runs entirely on the client side; it is a simulation with no backend. (as of now)

Work in progress.

Scaffolded with create-react-app - controlled using the default commands:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the project
npm test
```
